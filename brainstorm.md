3. Fuel
4. Oxygen

# Inspirations
1. Dead Space(for overall game design)
2. Undertale (for aesthetic)

# OBJECTIVE
Imagine a scenario where multiple space stations orbit various celestial bodies within the solar system. Astronauts must live, work, and play for long durations in microgravity environments. Not only does living under these conditions impact their physical well-being, sometimes they get bored! Your task is to design a game that leverages the unique challenges and opportunities of a microgravity environment to entertain and contribute to the overall well-being and cohesion of astronaut crews, enhancing their resilience and adaptability in the extraterrestrial frontier.

## Background
In the dynamic realm of space, the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity environments can be profound; both the body and the mind can experience issues. In addition to health concerns such as the loss of bone density and muscle mass, astronauts can become lonely and bored. The interplay between astronauts' physical and mental well-being is a paramount concern.

As humanity ventures further into space, leveraging the unique conditions of microgravity becomes increasingly imperative. Games and recreational activities crafted for Earth's gravity-bound existence fail to harness the potential of this distinct environment. Yet, as groups of individuals embark on longer-duration missions and occupy space habitats for increasingly extended periods, the importance of fostering physical fitness, enjoyment, and relaxation amidst the challenges of space habitation becomes evident. Thus, exploring innovative avenues to enhance spacefarers' mental and physical well-being while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by microgravity emerges as a pivotal endeavor in shaping the future of human space exploration!

## Objectives
Your challenge is to create a game for astronauts that leverages the unique microgravity environment of space and promotes their physical and psychological health.

Space is a unique environment! Don’t forget to account for the limitations of space habitats and equipment availability. Astronauts can become isolated and bored; can your game promote camaraderie, mental stimulation, and relaxation? Think about how to design a game that entertains and contributes to the overall well-being and cohesion of astronaut crews, while enhancing their resilience and adaptability in the extraterrestrial frontier.

Your challenge is not only to entertain, but also to support the physical and psychological health of astronauts while leveraging the microgravity environment. Will you develop an app, a physical game, a combination of the two, or some other type of tool? Think outside the box, incorporating elements of teamwork, mental agility, and physical activity in your game to captivate players and transport them to a world where the possibilities are as boundless as the cosmos itself!

Potential Considerations
You may (but are not required to) consider the following:

The game will be played in a microgravity environment—how can your game take advantage of this unique situation?
An individual’s physical and mental health are often interlinked; can your game impact both of these aspects?
Physical space is limited onboard the International Space Station and other space vessels; make sure your game is compact/small enough for astronauts to bring along.

## Levels Connected To Resources
1. shoot asteroids - NPC quest, Xera, she feeling lonely and needs Thor's help to shoot asteroids 
2. electrical - we need oxygen but the space station with the oxygen supply has powered down, repair the electrical room
3. memory game- your comics are locked away and the glitch in the system(among us memory game)
4. pong - [[Reason involved]]
